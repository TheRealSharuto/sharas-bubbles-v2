<h2>Hello World!</h2>

This blog was created originally to keep track of my tech journey, but as you can see I have not been very great at keeping track. However, now I am determined to be more consistant AND to also make this blog more about me as a person than just my existance in the tech world. 

The only social media I have is Linkedin, so to put some humanity to my character - especially for any future employers - I am not afraid to also express some inner musings I have about society, my experiences (both tech and non-tech), and other artistic things outside of programming. A journey is a journey - and I think it takes everything around my computer and I to make things work as well. 

Because of this, I have also decided to change the website name from Shara's Bubbles to Presenting Shara. It just sounds more classy. I think it also feels like this will be more outside of the box. The bubble has popped and now there is more than just me in my room in front of my computer. 

This blog will be about everything around me and how my tech journey progresses and gets affected by the changes I make. This blog does not exist to make money (even though I am very broke...), but serves as an expression of Shara and her talents. 

See you in the next post! Toodles.
