Today is Friday and the second day into the beginning of my senior year! Not only am I excited, but I am determined to be the most focused, most productive, but also the most well-rounded during my last year of school. Throughout the past several years, I have learned a lot about the importance of health, socializing, and family when it comes to being motivated to learn and study everyday. 

With that being said, I think that it is very important for me to set at least three goals this semester that can keep me on track. Additionally, I want to briefly discuss some other tools that I will be utilizing this semester so that I'll be not only a busy bee, but a healthy busy bee. <img src="https://ucarecdn.com/cbb14356-c303-4ca4-95f2-1b5eb09ff837/" width="40" class="inline" style="margin:0;" alt="pixelated bee gif"/>

## My 3 Goals for this Fall Semester

### 1. Go to sleep at the same time every day + get at least 7.5 hours of sleep a night.


Having a good sleep schedule is a game changer. Not only will I sleep better, but I'll have a much clearer mind at the beginning of the day and feel more refreshed than if I go to sleep at random times every day.

Ofcourse, this will take a lot of self-discipline and micromanagement of time. I already plan to make sacrifices in some of the things that I do in my day to day to make this senior year successful. 

In order to go to sleep at the same time AND get enough sleep with my extracurriculars, schoolwork, and job, I will need to put the anime-watching, kdrama watching, webtoon reading, and youtube watching on hold unless I am literally eating a meal at the same time. 

This goal will also teach me to stop saying yes to everything. Even though I am involved in extracurriculars and love what I do (dance), this last year is very important - school comes second - which means, health comes first.

### 2. Make at least 1.5 hrs of progress in school work every day.

At first, I thought about making my second goal about fitness. However, with how much I dance - I definetly already have that covered. This means that my next goal needs to be about managing dance, work, and school together.

There have been some days where I have gotten no work done because of how fast time seems to move after I clock out around 2:30 - 3:00pm. With lunch, chores, and poor choice of taking a nap and watching a little Youtube, I lose the chance of doing homework between that time and 6:00pm when I have to leave for dance practice. By the time I come home, it is usually around 10:45. I eat some dinner that I cook and bedtime is at 12:30. 

See the issue here? 

This goal that I have will force me to utilize my time management skills to their maximum potential, and create some innovative ways to make things more convenient in the future. 

No time to cook? Meal prep. Feel like I need a nap? A little caffeine will help (and better sleep). Want to watch youtube? Block Youtube. In fact, blocking distractions would potentially give me a 25 min window for some kind of power nap. 

A lot can be done in 1.5 hours if I am focused with a cup of tea. The only problem is getting started. However, technology does not always have to be a distraction. Utilizing these tools can help leverage the time available and make every minute count. 

### 3. Apply to at least 5 jobs a week.

This may seem like a very small and random goal - especially for someone who aleady has an internship. However, I think there is no issue with seeing what is out there and exploring new opportunities. As a soon to be new grad - I think it would be unwise to put all of my eggs in one basket - because it is impossible to tell what the future holds (especially in today's economy).

In fact, it is also a great opportunity to practice interview skills and get use to the new age long interview processes just in case I come across something super interesting and need the money / diverse experience. 

## Things I will use to reach these goals.

### 1. Pokemon Sleep

I recently downloaded an app called Pokemon Sleep and I have never been more motivated to get more sleep and sleep on time than now. I mean - I want these cute pokemon to be happy, so why wouldn't I sleep?

With this game, the only objectives are to sleep on time, get enough sleep, and befriend pokemon when you wake up. It is such a wholesome game that has really been helping me out and motivating me to manage my time better. Gamification of productivity might just be the best way to get yourself to be productive - especially if you have ADHD like me.

### 2. Google Calendar, Forest App, and simple alarms.

### 3. LinkedIn, ChatGPT, career events.
