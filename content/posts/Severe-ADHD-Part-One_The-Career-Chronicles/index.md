It has been MONTHS since I was able to make myself sit down and write a blog article. However, after appropriate medication and some major life changes, I am coming out from underneath the bed…the inside of your closet…your mirror in the dark (okay, let me stop now).

I’ve been reflecting. A lot has happened within the past two years.  I worked in healthcare, switched to admin, and now I am in tech in a very short timeframe. The first two industries of my career had obviously not worked out - but they helped me learn much more about myself.

There is one thing I experienced with every one of my previous jobs that helped me realize something - the *honeymoon phase*.

## The Job Honeymoon Phase
![Woman twirling in a rolling office chair happily](https://ucarecdn.com/ce016ade-6e4b-42cc-bdf7-c2fa791d6bba/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)
My frequent job honeymoon phase experience made me realize that something was amiss in me compared to my peers. So, what is the job honeymoon phase?

In my experience, the job honeymoon phase is a *phenomenon of hyperfocus and excellent performance for the first 3 to 4 months on the job*. 

How it goes: I have successfully convinced myself that I have found the greatest starting point for my career to get to where I want to be - and that there is lots of opportunity to grow in the company. I accomplish the most during this time, rarely look at my phone while on the clock, and am hyperaware of everything going on around me.

I am overly ecstatic about all of the duties of the job even if it in no way, shape, or form matches my personality or the job description. I ignore all workplace red flags and only focus on the positives. I am imaginative of all the possibilities of me climbing up the corporate ladder and acquiring these leadership positions that I never have even wanted in the first place. However, somehow aiming for that position in that moment just makes sense for the future despite everything else.

This all sounds kind of great, right? But it is short-lived. It was not long before tasks became monotonous, I felt stuck, or I began to not make progress. Distractors would become ever more apparent to the point where I can not ignore them because of boredom. Even without a phone, I would space out and stare at nothing for several minutes at a time. Thus, the newness of my presence fades out. All of my flaws become more apparent.

It is at this point where things stick out more about me - especially if I realize I am not actually interested in what I am doing. I work slower, miss details, miss things that people say to me, and become forgetful.

As you would have guessed, all of this would be a BIG issue when it comes to working in healthcare or as an admin, so I quickly tapped out of those fields.  I felt humiliated by my fragile mind and unfit for any job. It did not matter how much I was trying on my own - I felt a slave to some kind of entity that had it’s claws wrapped around some part of my brain.

So, what is happening here?

## What is ADHD?

![Two children dancing on a graphic title that says "ADHD"](https://ucarecdn.com/b72e762d-a6f5-436d-be39-95c439bc64b9/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

ADHD is a common neurodevelopment disorder that begins in childhood. It means having a poor executive function, and can often last into adulthood. In fact, it is now an established fact that women are more likely to be diagnosed very late and misdiagnosed with other mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression (which, often coexist with ADHD). The reason for these other diagnoses are because the neurology of it all is related - ADHD *is* associated with abnormally low levels of neurotransmitters transmitting nervous stimuli (such as dopamine and noradrenaline) between the prefrontal cortical area and the basal ganglia.

And that is where I am going to stop speaking factually and start speaking from experience. 

![A man in a suit standing on a thread that leads into a scribble scrabble mess](https://ucarecdn.com/785c9205-f177-4cb7-ad64-c60ba455bfc1/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

ADHD is thinking of one thing and getting sidetracked for an entire hour by a small distraction, only to suddenly stop and wonder, “What was I doing?”

Here is an example of something specific that happens often. Imagine, I am in a restaurant with friends:

My predominantly inattentive ADHD is being with a group of people and being unable to keep track of a conversation and stay on topic in my own head. My first reaction is to withdraw completely and just listen as best as I can while hearing the clashing of plates in the kitchen, hearing the music playing, seeing that interesting-looking person that just walked by, thinking of the plants I forgot to water, my phone that is about to die, and oh what is it that was so important that I needed to do today but I did not do? All of this PLUS the other conversation happening on the other side of the table - I am thrown into a river with a very fast current and I grab anything and tap anything to try to get stable again and not fall down the waterfall and crash into the killer rocks below!

Basically, ADHD is the inner turmoil of the brain on sonic the hedgehog speed.

Okay, now I will get into the specifics.. 

## Severe ADHD Burnout

![A skeleton lying down with a stickynote that says "burnout" on it](https://ucarecdn.com/3cfd9d41-15eb-4049-a895-807e8b980b82/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

The term “burnout” has become increasingly popular amongst the general population within the past few years. However, ADHD burnout is a different ballgame - especially when it invades your career and personal relationships. 

For me, burnout was like some form of depression:

Suddenly I feel less, do less, like things less, and generally just feel *less of a human being*. Tasks seem monotonous and boring - especially if I get too use to the same simple tasks over and over again. My brain shuts down faster and I become exhausted - almost falling asleep at my desk. I wake up tired, walk around tired, breathe tired, and sometimes get too tired to even chew the rest of my food. I lose my appetite and lose more sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night with racing thoughts of what should be getting done - and they simply do not get done.

Then, I feel a pang of guilt so intense and a sense of worthlessness. 

“Why can I not be like other people and just get the work done and pay attention? What is wrong with me?” 

I start to feel isolated, as if I am in an echoing empty room looking at the world through a foggy window. I become easily irritated and spend most of my free time under the covers in my bed. Instead of simple tasks and chores taking 10x longer to do (as per usual), they begin to take 50x longer to do. At that point, I just don’t do them. This all results in anxiety, chronic pain, and depression.

Why?

The reason why burnout is different with ADHD is that we work 10x harder to get things done than the average person. On top of that, I work 20x harder to appear even better in my career field as a black woman. I accept it for what it is, and I do not think too much about it all because I just see it as a different path to success. It all works out…

…until it all crashes down.

## Severe ADHD in the Workplace

![A frustrated woman staring at a macbook air laptop](https://ucarecdn.com/aa7b2152-b406-4aca-8605-125c02c50e54/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

ADHD in the workplace, especially when untreated, can lead to the downfall of your career. I saw this happening to me in real time. There were many things my ADHD contributed to, such as frequent tardiness, frequent mistakes, inability to go from one project to the next seamlessly, disorganization, insatiable boredom, and an inability to predict the time needed for tasks. Life ***itself*** is very hard with all of these negative attributes - but throwing on a job on top of that leads to inevitable chaos surrounding a person who does not even know they have ADHD.

It did not matter how many solutions I implemented, how many sticky notes I wrote, how many reminders I set, how much coffee I drunk, nor how many articles I read about carrying on a proper conversation and picking up the right details - it seemed that the neglected neurodivergency of my brain would always win.

Yet, everyone’s experience with ADHD in the workplace will be different - especially if someone is super interested in what they are doing. However, almost everything that manifested from my ADHD in the workplace - especially the boredom - was from not being as interested as I thought I would be with the job. Thank goodness I discovered my love for code! Otherwise, it could have gotten worse.

## The dangers of untreated ADHD when it comes to Career

![Increasing unemployment rate graph on a chalkboard](https://ucarecdn.com/3925af32-ffda-47ed-8835-99d625322b79/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

The job market for those with learning disabilities - and any disability in general - is very bleak. The data speaks for itself: Individuals with ADHD earn 17% lower income than their neurotypical peers and have 12.19% more days of unemployment [^1] [^2]. Additionally, only 22.2% of adults had ordinary work as their source of income, compared to 72% of the general population in a study with 149 adults with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD[^3].

With ADHD, we are more likely to get terminated, jump from job to job, burn out, and turn to disability pension [^4]. 

Can it get any worse? Well, it does, but wait for the upsides at the end.

Because we are much more likely to lose our jobs, we are much more likely to lose everything else. With ADHD, it is easy to lose the support of those around us and come to the position where we have been terminated with no one to fall back on while we look for our next position. One study showed that the homelessness rate of people with ADHD at the average age of 41 was a whopping 24% [^5]. Of course, more often than not, ADHD may come with its fair share of other mental illnesses that can develop in adulthood, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, increasing the risk for homelessness.

As anyone can see, not having a career can have a domino effect for *anyone*. However, when you have ADHD it is a lot harder to pull yourself up by the bootstraps and climb out of the clutches of your own neurobiology.

## The Solution: How to fight ADHD Symptoms while working

![Colorful brain aesthetic](https://ucarecdn.com/6959d89b-9ef6-45cd-ae9b-8657205ab344/)

One day, I will write a more specific blog post for this very section of this article! However, here is a quick list of 10 things that have been working for me in my current internship to stay on task:

1. **NOISE CANCELLING HEADPHONES**…A MUST

![A man wearing noise cancelling headphones](https://ucarecdn.com/d7129bc6-421f-4db6-bb2e-6879a84fbd6b/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

Noise cancelling helps me…well…cancel the noise. The neighbors are loud and the big noisy trucks outside of my house break my concentration in an instant. Do NOT get me started with the barking dogs. Once my concentration breaks I can fall into a domino effect of random thoughts that turn into daydreams and reminiscing over the past…BAD.

2. **Set Timers** 

![A timer counting down on a cellphone](https://ucarecdn.com/24f330f7-4176-4756-ac1d-7fb14021f190/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

Just because I am on medication does not mean that I suddenly have ultra instinct productivity powers. I set timers in 30 minute intervals just in case I fell off task. The timer is a signal to myself to suddenly become self-aware. What am I doing in that moment? Am I on my phone? Am I falling asleep? Well, I am definitely awake now!

3. **Frequent small breaks**

![A wooden figurine resting its head on a mouse](https://ucarecdn.com/22e05276-dc19-4e2d-a242-73a915e8379d/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

Unless the task is purely coding, which is not exactly the case for an intern like me, my focus tapers after 25 minutes or so. I’ll take a tiny break around then to take a brisk walk around the house for one minute, pet the dog for a minute, or just do a little stretch and some mindful breathing for 3 minutes.

4. **Do not ignore your hunger**

![Two people holding bowls of healthy food](https://ucarecdn.com/a0381690-c2be-4ee2-88f3-bf9d645b88e4/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

This usually happens if I am just too into the project. But do you notice…? Your quality of work decreases when your stomach is angry with you! It is good to have snacks or food on deck, because hunger is almost as distracting as a cell phone.

5. **Frequent reminders…and reminders for your reminders**

![Three papers with the word "reminder" on them](https://ucarecdn.com/8c48081a-2515-4bf7-aea4-737103677a71/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

I am an absolute master at somehow ignoring reminders. It is like my brain has converted them to an annoying background noise that I will close out immediately on all devices. So, I set three reminders/notifications for the same thing. I make sure all of my reminders are INVASIVE. They take up my entire computer screen or my entire phone screen. Forget those banners that appear at the top of the screen - my eyes have been trained to ignore them. Reminders have to be so annoying that I can’t ignore them. 

6. **Journaling the night before**

![A woman writing in a journal on a bright couch](https://ucarecdn.com/f685500b-9805-4207-a8ec-48a70422fc7c/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

The worst is starting the day with an extreme amount of things on my mind. The best is spilling everything into a journal and pretending I told someone my life story. I also am able to process my emotions better and analyze things so that I can solve conflicts both inside and outside of work. 

7. **Rewarding oneself**
![A present](https://ucarecdn.com/259639df-721a-4602-a547-dbe8051c668b/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

If I achieve something, I’m buying that amazon item I’ve been looking at for the past month!

8. **Visual Aids - the sticky notes might help for you**
![A person writing on a sticky notes next to many other sticky notes](https://ucarecdn.com/8e404f11-628b-4266-afc8-18c6696ce8ab/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

I have those moments where I space out and look at my environment. It is as if my brain is trying to distract itself since I refuse to use my phone. So then I take a moment to look at the sticky notes. Hopefully they will remind me of something important before the reminders do.

9. **Vision Board as your computer background**

![A board with pictures taped to it](https://ucarecdn.com/9d45c0fb-f129-46de-92f9-cfaefcc18376/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)
    
This can be a BIG motivator. I made a vision board at the beginning of 2023 using Canva. I set it as my background so that whenever I come out of a window on my computer or end up distracted - I am reminded of my goals and why I am working so hard.

10. **Productivity Apps and phone usage reports**

![Cellphone with social media apps](https://ucarecdn.com/0539a7e3-72ec-406d-bd69-3b21e59d7cb7/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)
    
There are plenty apps, such as the Forest App, that prevent you from using your phone. You can still use it, but your cute little tree will die! 😳

11. **Medication**

![A bottle of pills with the words "ADHD Medication" on it](https://ucarecdn.com/a4fee48f-d03f-4e06-ade5-1034add59a95/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)    
    
You can do all of these things, but it does not change the fact that ADHD is an actual neurodevelopment disorder - not just simple disorganization. For severe ADHD, medication is nearly a must and recommended by psychiatrists. It **does** help, but it takes a bit of trial and error to find the right medication if you have a mental illness or chronic illness along with it. 

## There *are* benefits to hiring someone with ADHD

![A headshot of Albert Einstein](https://ucarecdn.com/08dc3c62-2d0f-41e2-a13f-3213d5ee9d08/-/preview/-/quality/smart/-/format/auto/)

I’ve seen some good qualities making rounds on the internet regarding individuals with ADHD, and it is actually quite refreshing to see. ADHD is **not fun**, but, it does not have to be the end of one’s life - nor a purely negative experience.

For my employers out there, please do not worry. Individuals with ADHD can bring lots of colorful ideas and innovations to the workplace. Since we think differently, we bring new perspectives to the workplace and often are not afraid to approach things from a different angle. For example, since I have a disability of my own, I frequently think about other’s with disabilities when it comes to creating websites. My biggest goal is to make all my projects accessible, and aid my job in making their projects accessible for those with disabilities as well. I had discovered that many websites and applications lack accessibleness when it comes to functionality and design - so I took up studying Web Accessibility as part of my internship and have been interested in developing advanced software in the future that will aid those with disabilities.

But that is just one personal example that I am proud of myself for. 

### There are many famous individuals who have become successful and also have ADHD. 

Here are 11 of many!

- David Neeleman (CEO of JetBlue) [^6]
- John F Kennedy(35th U.S President) [^7]
- Bill Gates(American business magnate and philanthropist) [^7]
- James Carville(American political consultant, author, and occasional actor) [^8]
- Charles Schwab (Chairman of The Charles Schwab Corporation) [^9]
- Diane Swonk (Economic Advisor and Chief Economist) [^9]
- Emma Watson (Actress) [^10]
- IN THEORY, Albert Einstein (famous theoretical physicist) [^11]
- Lisa Ling (Journalist) [^12]
- Annie Antón (Researcher in Computer Science, Mathematical Logic, and Bioinformatics)[^12]
- Lara Mendonça (Head of Design at Twitter)[^12]

This list was getting so good. I feel like this deserves a blog post of it’s own as well!

Well that is it for now folks. Here are some sources for my fellow friends with ADHD, or, friends who want to know more about ADHD and those who experience ADHD. Remember, ADHD is a spectrum - many people can experience things differently - but the general symptoms are very intuitive.
