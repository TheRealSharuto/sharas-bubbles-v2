## Where Have I Been?

A little over a week ago, I finished another Computer Science semester feeling much different than how I started. Around three months ago, I had decided to start taking my mindfulness journey much more seriously after doing lots of research on meditation, mindfulness, and their effects on the brain.

### What is mindfulness?

Mindfulness can be described in so many ways, and can apply to all aspects of life. To put simply, it is embracing stillness within you and staying in the present moment. You let go of worries and thoughts of the past and the future when practicing mindfulness. It is welcoming the transparations of your surroundings and observing without judgement. 

Mindfulness can be practiced anywhere at anytime. In fact, the goal is to be mindful through every waking moment! When you are walking, when you are driving, when you are eating, when you are listening to someone speak, when you are standing in line, when you are grocery shopping, and even when you are showering - these are all moments where you can choose to focus on the present moment.

### Why do we need mindfulness?

To most, practicing mindfulness may just sound like spiritual mumbo jumbo. Talking about it to friends and family may make them tilt their head sideways and think you are losing your mind. However, the truth is that most of us have already lost our minds in the digital garbage of modern society. ‚ÄúMindfulness‚Äù sounds more like getting your mind *back* to me üòâ.

Lets think.

What is it that you do when you have those ‚Äúawkward‚Äù moments to yourself? When you are waiting for someone in public, waiting in line, eating by yourself, or even *sitting on the toilet*. That‚Äôs right. You pull out your phone. I‚Äôve observed in countless situations - from concerts to eating with friends and family, that people check on their phone during every still or boring moment (or worst, in the middle of someone speaking!). 

What would have happened to us before cell phones were around? What would we be doing in those moments? 

We would simply *be*. 

We would talk to the person next to us and learn something new or share something that could impact someone‚Äôs life. 

We would look around and smile (or frown) at someone - but make that quick mini connection. 

We would observe our surroundings and reflect on our day - what happened that was embarrassing? 

What happened that was exciting? 

How do I work on myself or this situation I have in one of my relationships? 

What should I write for my next book? What should I do for my class project? 

How do I confess to her? How do I admit this to him? What would I do in a zombie apocalypse? 

Or we would just be in *stillness - smelling, gazing, tasting, enjoying life.* 

But this does not occur often anymore, we spend so much time in other people‚Äôs lives that we do not reflect on our own or enjoy the present moment. Or, we are running away from our own thoughts and feels only to distract ourselves with online entertainment. 

Learning to be in the present moment and practice mindfulness has also allowed me to control my tendencies to reach for my phone. 

In times of letting go of mindfulness in some moments - I choose to reflect on my day and think of ways to create something positive out of any ‚Äúpoor‚Äù moment and be grateful for those moments while embracing and emphasizing the little great moments.

*This* is why we need mindfulness. 

## What I did

I started with meditating just a few times a week for around 10 minutes. During this time period I was also reading articles and watching documentaries about mindfulness. Eventually, my motivation for mindfulness in my life became so intense that I made it a top priority to meditate at least once a day. Now, I meditate and practice mindfulness everyday anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour a day. Sometimes I‚Äôll even have two meditation sessions in a day.

Through meditating, practicing mindfulness, breathwork, journaling, and getting to know myself better - I have drastically reduced my ADHD symptoms. I feel more patient, calm, less frustrated, less impulsive, and much more open to criticism and judgement. Within the past two weeks alone, my overall outlook and feelings toward life itself have taken a much more optimistic turn. 

Here I am, writing a blog post to a blog I had originally given up on - but suddenly feel a calling to again. I am owing that to my mindfulness techniques.

## So‚Ä¶ what about this blog? What‚Äôs the purpose?

I will be continuing this blog! I think my previous post I had already addressed that I did not want my blog to focus purely on coding and productivity related things. However, I think those things are where my brain currently sits when it comes to inspiration to write about something since I have one more super busy semester left of school. After I graduate the blog may change drastically.

For now, I plan to start making mini posts about the personal projects I am starting with JavaScript, React, and Python. I‚Äôll also make mini posts about progress in school and in my mindfulness journey. Indeed, I will be writing tomorrow on Christmas as well to make up for lost time. I am no stranger to doing ‚Äúwork‚Äù on the holidays! 

## Why the big hold up on posting ü§®¬†?

In previous posts, I often would do research and give statistics on things I wrote about, but things started feeling like a school assignment so I lost motivation while turning my focus toward other hobbies, school, and my health situation. 

I chose to reset - the point of the blog is not really to garner attention with big percentages and attract someone trying to do research on something. Nor is the purpose to make money off of the blog (I mean, if there ever came a point where I had enough traffic to do so, I wouldn‚Äôt let the chance slip!). 

The purpose of this blog is to express myself; to show things I do that I feel are significant enough to help people, motivate people on a similar path, or make people think. Since I have no other online presence, this is the best way to portray an accurate image of myself to employers, friends, or people wondering what happened to me after I fell off the face of the earth (aka, someone who may know me, but does not talk to me). If the purpose is just those things, then I could write a lot more and leave the research up to the reader. 

I am not a researcher or scientist, and this blog is not for school - so I‚Äôll leave the stats up to those folks. Now I do not have to let the blog die.

### Concluding‚Ä¶

So what is something you have been doing to improve your mental and/or physical health toward the end of this year? If you haven‚Äôt been putting effort into anything like that, do you have plans for the new year? Something to think about üòâ.

I do not make New Year's resolutions anymore, but I do have ongoing short term and long term goals that will carry over into 2024 - this blog is one of them!

Here is my Christmas present to you, I am sharing a great documentary on meditation:
